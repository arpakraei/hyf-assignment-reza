Learning Best Practices


Crafting Strong Prompts First: Invest time in clear requirements and constraints. Better prompts yield better code and fewer revisions needed.

Providing Sufficient Context:Define business requirements, technical constraints, and project strategy. This helps AI tools generate truly relevant solutions.

Understand Before Copying:AI is a tutor, not a replacement for learning. Comprehend every line. Test independently. Build problem-solving skills that survive without AI.


Key Takeaways
Start Simple :Begin with semantic HTML. Add only what's necessary.
Use Tools Wisely:AI enhances learning when used as a guide, not a shortcut.
Test Everything:Verify your code works across browsers and devices before shipping.




1) How much time should we spend on writing a good prompt at the beginning stage?
Answer: 
Enough time based on the complexity of the code, the level of detail we need, and mastery of prompt engineering.





2) What is sufficient context we need to provide to AI?
Answer: 
We need to define business requirements, constraints, project strategy, and context awareness.



3) Identify 3 risks of relying too much on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture.
Answer: 
Shadow of understanding: You copy working code without understanding why it works, making it hard to debug or adapt later. Weak problem-solving skills: You can't develop the critical thinking needed to code independently. Confidence trap: You feel competent, but you can't do anything later when AI isn't available. Use AI as a tutor to explain and guide. AI should work for you, not you for AI.
